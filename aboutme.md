    <h3>The Garden, the Ice, and the Great Outdoors</h3>
    <p>In the heart of activity, you'll find me - be it tending to my garden, skating across an icy rink, or navigating through calm river waters. These are not merely hobbies; they form an integral part of who I am. Gardening is a passion that allows me to connect with the Earth and revel in its beauty. Coaching youth hockey lets me channel my energy, igniting the same passion in the players, and canoe camping fuels my adventurous spirit. Life with four kids is the ultimate active journey, each day bringing a new and exciting challenge.</p>

    <h3>Professional</h3>
    <p>My professional journey, rooted in system administration, has seen me evolve into a proficient DevOps specialist. My expertise lies in constructing and managing robust infrastructures, with best practices and automation serving as guiding principles. My workspace, over the years, has encompassed everything from bare metal servers in data centers to cloud platforms like GKE and AWS.</p>
    
    <p>My toolkit, which includes diverse technologies ranging from Bash to Python, and Docker to Kubernetes, has empowered me to provide invaluable developer support. I've adeptly implemented GitOps across various systems, including Jenkins, GitHub, and GitLab. My work with Terraform and Helm has also been extensive, orchestrating sophisticated CI/CD pipelines for Kubernetes deployments in a multitude of environments and across numerous programming languages.</p>
    
    <p>My track record is a solid testament to my ability to deliver tangible results. However, my mission goes beyond merely achieving project-specific goals. I am committed to making technology more accessible and effective for developers. By streamlining deployment procedures and containerizing developer environments, I aim to reduce complexity, increase productivity, and turn every development task into a seamless experience.</p>
