    <h3>The Garden, the Ice, and the Great Outdoors</h3>
    <p>In the heart of activity, you'll find me - be it tending to my garden, skating across an icy rink, or navigating through calm river waters. These are not merely hobbies; they form an integral part of who I am. Gardening is a passion that allows me to connect with the Earth and revel in its beauty. Coaching youth hockey lets me channel my energy, igniting the same passion in the players, and canoe camping fuels my adventurous spirit. Life with four kids is the ultimate active journey, each day bringing a new and exciting challenge.</p>

    <h3>Professional</h3>
    <p>My professional journey, rooted in system administration, has seen me evolve into a proficient DevOps specialist. I've honed my skills in constructing and managing robust infrastructures, using best practices and automation as guiding principles. Over time, my workspace has spanned from bare metal servers in data centers to virtual instances on cloud platforms like GKE and AWS. </p>
    
    <p>With a toolkit ranging from Bash to Python, and Docker to Kubernetes, I've provided critical developer support and implemented GitOps across various systems including Jenkins, GitHub, and GitLab. Additionally, I've utilized Terraform for Kubernetes and Helm deployments, orchestrating intricate CI/CD pipelines in diverse environments and across multiple programming languages.</p>
    
    <p>A solid track record of successful projects is a testament to my ability to deliver results. However, my role goes beyond achieving project-specific goals. Ultimately, I strive to make technology more user-friendly and effective for developers. By creating automation scripts and streamlining deployment procedures, I focus on reducing complexity and boosting productivity, making each development task a seamless experience.</p>
