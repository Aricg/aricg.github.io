    <h3>Garden, Ice, and Outdoors</h3>
    <p>I'm an active soul, constantly in pursuit of engagement. In the garden, my hands are in the soil, connecting with nature. On the ice, I play recreationally and coach youth hockey, passing on my passion for the sport. On the river, I enjoy canoe camping, satisfying my love for adventure. Balancing these activities with raising four kids gives me pause to smile. </p>


    <h3>Professional</h3>
    <p>My professional journey, rooted in system administration, has seen me evolve into a proficient DevOps specialist. My expertise lies in constructing and managing robust infrastructures, with best practices and automation serving as guiding principles. My workspace, over the years, has encompassed everything from bare metal servers in data centers to cloud platforms like GKE and AWS.</p>
    
    <p>My toolkit, which includes diverse technologies ranging from Bash to Python, and Docker to Kubernetes, has empowered me to provide invaluable developer support. I've adeptly implemented GitOps across various systems, including Jenkins, GitHub, and GitLab. My work with Terraform and Helm has also been extensive, orchestrating sophisticated CI/CD pipelines for Kubernetes deployments in a multitude of environments and across numerous programming languages.</p>
    
    <p>My track record is a solid testament to my ability to deliver tangible results. However, my mission goes beyond merely achieving project-specific goals. I am committed to making technology more accessible and effective for developers. By streamlining deployment procedures and containerizing developer environments, I aim to reduce complexity, increase productivity, and turn every development task into a seamless experience.</p>
