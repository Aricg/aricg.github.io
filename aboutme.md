    <h3>The Garden, the Ice, and the Great Outdoors</h3>
    <p>In the heart of activity, you'll find me - be it tending to my garden, skating across an icy rink, or navigating through calm river waters. These are not merely hobbies; they form an integral part of who I am. Gardening is a passion that allows me to connect with the Earth and revel in its beauty. Coaching youth hockey lets me channel my energy, igniting the same passion in the players, and canoe camping fuels my adventurous spirit. Life with four kids is the ultimate active journey, each day bringing a new and exciting challenge.</p>
    <p>or?<p>
    <p>I'm always active, from digging in the garden, to coaching youth hockey, to packing up for a canoe camping trip. With four kids, every day is an adventure. And amidst the contemporary obsession with digital lives, I find joy in these tactile, real-world experiences.</p>

    <h3>Professional</h3>
    <p>Professionally, I navigate the tech realm with a focus on scaling infrastructure. The combination of best practices and automation is the compass guiding my journey. </p>

    <p>or?<p>
    <p>My professional journey is steeped in technology. With my roots in system administration, I've grown into a reliable DevOps professional, currently serving as a Principal DevOps at OneSpan. I specialize in building and managing robust infrastructures, guided by the principles of best practices and automation. Over the years, I've worked on a myriad of platforms including AWS, AKS, and Kubernetes, and mastered multiple programming languages. Be it developer support, deploying and contributing to in-house Terraform for AWS Kubernetes deployments, or orchestrating sophisticated CI/CD pipelines, I've built a solid track record of delivering results. </p>

    <p>In every role, my goal is the same: to make technology more accessible and effective for those using it. From creating automation scripts to simplifying deployment procedures, I focus on eliminating complexity and enhancing productivity. My experience spans across various domains including backend (Java, Springboot), frontend (TypeScript, Node, Yarn), mobile applications (Android/IOS), and even extends to automating legacy Ruby applications.</p>

    <p>or?<p>
    <p>As a seasoned professional in the tech realm, I'm currently honing my skills as a Principal DevOps at OneSpan. My journey, rooted in system administration, has shaped me into a key player in the DevOps world. I find myself at home amidst robust infrastructures, focusing on applying best practices and automation to navigate their complexities.</p>
    
    <p>One of my key strengths is mastering platforms and tools integral to the modern tech stack. Kubernetes and Helm have become my playground, where I spend my time building, deploying, and streamlining systems. My comfort zone extends beyond infrastructure management to the realm of programming, with Python being one of my mainstays.</p>
    
    <p>I take pride in making technology more accessible and effective. Be it backend support with Java and Springboot, frontend adventures with TypeScript and Node, mobile application development on Android/IOS, or even legacy Ruby application automation, my goal remains the same: simplify and enhance.
