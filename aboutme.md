    <h3>The Garden, the Ice, and the Great Outdoors</h3>
    <p>In the heart of activity, you'll find me - be it tending to my garden, skating across an icy rink, or navigating through calm river waters. These are not merely hobbies; they form an integral part of who I am. Gardening is a passion that allows me to connect with the Earth and revel in its beauty. Coaching youth hockey lets me channel my energy, igniting the same passion in the players, and canoe camping fuels my adventurous spirit. Life with four kids is the ultimate active journey, each day bringing a new and exciting challenge.</p>

    <h3>Professional</h3>
    <p>Professionally, I navigate the tech realm with a focus on scaling infrastructure. The combination of best practices and automation is the compass guiding my journey. Much like conducting a symphony, I'm adept at running meetings, ensuring all components sync harmoniously to produce desired outcomes.</p>

    <h3>The Dual Nature</h3>
    <p>In a lighter vein, don't be surprised if you find me belting out a tune at a karaoke night. Just as comfortable in a business suit as I am with a mic in my hand, I embrace life's many contrasts.</p>
